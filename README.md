## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

From learning to create a product preview card component using HTML and CSS, 🤓 I learned about:

1️⃣ How to use HTML elements such as div, img, and span to create the basic structure of a component. 🧑‍💻
2️⃣ How to use CSS to style the appearance such as setting colors, fonts, and text sizes. 🌈
3️⃣ The use of display and flexbox properties to layout the component. 🧑‍💼

💪 Overall, I feel more confident in creating perfect HTML and CSS components after learning about this!

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

1️⃣ Refining my skills in using CSS grid and layout techniques. 🧑‍💼
2️⃣ Experimenting with advanced CSS effects such as animations and transitions. 🎨
3️⃣ Improving my understanding of responsive design principles. 📱

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) - The w3schools website helps me make websites responsive by providing easy-to-understand tutorials and examples that can be used as references. I can also use the available trial console on the site to try out my HTML and CSS code and see the results live.
